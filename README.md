This is my first build through The Odin Project.
During this project I have learned some of the basic HTML structure needed to build a website.
Such things as adding a boilerplate, headings, text, images, links, and creating ordered and unordered lists.
I will be updating this project frequently, and updating the README as a progress.
In the meantime, enjoy these few recipes for delicious food I have added to my first webpage.
